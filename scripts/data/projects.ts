      <h2>Efficient Rooftop Solar for Urban Home</h2>
      <p>The Sharma family in Dehradun wanted to reduce their monthly electricity bills, which were averaging around ₹3,000. They have a flat roof with excellent sunlight exposure, making it an ideal candidate for a rooftop solar system.</p>
      
      <h3>System Configuration</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Capacity:</strong> 3 kW On-Grid System</li>
        <li><strong>Panels:</strong> High-efficiency Monocrystalline modules</li>
        <li><strong>Inverter:</strong> Growatt 3kW String Inverter</li>
        <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Elevated galvanized iron structure</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Impact</h3>
      <p>Since installation, the Sharma family has seen a dramatic drop in their grid consumption. They are now generating approximately 12-14 units per day, which covers almost 90% of their energy needs. The return on investment is expected to be achieved in under 4 years.</p>

      <h2>Hybrid Solar Solution for Reliable Power</h2>
      <p>Located in Rishikesh, Verma Villa experiences occasional power cuts during the monsoon season. The owners needed a solution that would not only save money but also provide backup power for critical appliances.</p>

      <h3>System Highlights</h3>
      <p>We designed a 5kW Hybrid System integrated with a lithium-ion battery bank. This allows the home to run autonomously during outages while still exporting excess power to the grid during normal operation.</p>

      <h3>Customer Feedback</h3>
      <blockquote>"The transition seamlessly handles power cuts. We don't even notice when the grid goes down anymore. Plus, the savings are a huge bonus!"</blockquote>

      <h2>Compact System for Small Families</h2>
      <p>Proving that you don't need a massive roof to go solar, the Gupta residence in Haridwar installed a compact 2kW system. It perfectly offsets their modest energy consumption.</p>
      
      <h3>Project Details</h3>
      <p>The installation was completed in just 2 days with minimal disruption. The system utilizes space-saving high-efficiency panels to maximize generation in a limited area.</p>
